# 英菲克(inphic)产品预设<br>Inphic Product Presets
爱好者自发行为，非商业作品。  
目前仅制作了我自己购买使用的 IN9、IN10。其中 IN9 系列里，Pro 是原始工程，其他三个都是直接替换图片。

A fan-made project, non-commercial in nature.  
Currently, only the IN9 and IN10 models I personally purchased and use have been created. Within the IN9 series, the "Pro" version is the original project file, while the other three are simply image replacements.

## 项目编辑<br>Project Editing
图片使用 **Adobe Fireworks CS6**(2012) 开发，工程文件格式为 `*.fw.png`，因此你可以用 Fireworks 编辑这些文件。本软件已经停产，但是因为非常好用，我从 **Macromedia Flash/Dreamweaver/Fireworks MX**(2002) 时代开始一直在使用它。

The images were created using **Adobe Fireworks CS6**, with project files in the `*.fw.png` format. You can therefore edit these files using Fireworks. Although this software is discontinued, it remains my preferred tool since the **Macromedia Flash/Dreamweaver/Fireworks MX**(2002) era due to its excellent functionality.

>亲爱的用户你好！  
>&emsp;很抱歉才看到亲的反馈，对于你的需求是需要我们产品的透明底的PNG图片对吧，这个在我们官网上找到对应的产品型号下载保存好白底图，然后用P图工具改成透明底PNG格式就可以了。我这边也找了部分产品的PNG透明图给你，在附件，麻烦查收看看这种是否可行。

> Dear user, hello!  
>&emsp;Sorry for the late reply. You need transparent-background PNG images of our products, right? You can find the corresponding product model on our official website, download and save the white-background image, then use an image editing tool to convert it into a transparent-background PNG format. I've also attached some transparent PNG images of our products for you—please check the attachment and let me know if this works.

## 个人日记：为什么我买这些鼠标<br>Personal Diary: Why did I buy these mice
我从 10 年前开始工作，我的工作需要绘图，需要经常切换鼠标DPI，所以需要高 DPI 和能切换 DPI 的鼠标。  
先是用坏了 2 个罗技（Logitech） G100s 鼠标，后来陆续买了 1 个 G102 初代和 3 个 G102 第二代鼠标。  
还用过同学当生日礼物送给我的雷蛇（RAZER）蝰蛇标准版，手感非常好，但是没有 DPI 切换按钮，画图很不得方便。  
有段时间对人体工程学感兴趣，买了一个 多彩（Delux）M618XU 立体鼠标，用了一年习惯了，却因为大拇指朝上，被空调吹出了腱鞘炎。  
换回 G102 时，发现滚轮乱动，比如往上滚电脑上却是往下滚，想修发现手工费太贵不如买个新的。  
寻找新的时候发现了 20 几块的 英菲克 W1，几乎打平 G102 的性能指标，就是模具手感差。我买的轻音版，在家里使用安静很多。后来为了兼顾大鼠标的舒适手感、轻音、高 DPI、DPI 按钮、支持蓝牙和有线连接，就买了轻音版 IN9。结果 IN9 对于我老婆的手太大了，她不喜欢，所以又给她买了 IN10。

I've been working for 10 years, and my job involves frequent graphic design work requiring constant DPI switching on my mouse. I started with two Logitech G100s mice, both of which eventually wore out. After that, I bought one first-generation G102 and three second-generation G102s.  
I also used a RAZER DeathAdder Standard edition gifted by a classmate for my birthday—the feel was excellent, but lacking a DPI button made graphic work inconvenient.  
For a while, I became interested in ergonomics and bought a Delux M618XU vertical mouse. I used it for a year and got used to it, but holding my thumb upward caused tendonitis from air conditioning drafts.  
When I switched back to the G102, I found the scroll wheel malfunctioned (e.g., scrolling up on the mouse resulted in downward scrolling on screen). I considered repairing it, but the labor cost was nearly as much as buying a new one.  
While searching for a replacement, I discovered the inphic W1, priced around 20 RMB, with performance nearly matching the G102—though its mold design felt less comfortable. I bought the silent version, which works much more quietly at home. Later, wanting a mouse that combined comfort for larger hands, quiet operation, high DPI, DPI switching button, and dual-mode Bluetooth/wired connectivity, I purchased the silent version of the IN9. However, the IN9 turned out to be too large for my wife's hands, and she didn't like it, so I bought her an IN10 instead.
